I was successfully able to create a simple sine wave that changed
based off of the Y value of the cursor, as well as the background changing
colors along with it. I also programmed a Reverb slider, which is pretty
impractical right now, but will hopefully be interactive once I complete
deeper synthesis. What I plan on doing next is implementing some clickable
objects that can direct you to a different link (portfolio, linkedIN etc).
I need to synthesize ambient textures rather than just a sine wave, and 
change the colors, maybe a more fine tune color depending on the x-axis?
I also need a way to control the volume, maybe it can be a flat number,
but it's just insanely loud as of right now.

So heres a to-do list:
1. Better synthesis, ambient objects? Different wave-types? More voices?
2. Better background colors. More interactive, better fades, make it cool.
3. Interactive links, redirect user to other sources.
4. Test on iPhone, since they don't have a cursor and its only tap, I need
to figure out a way around that.
5. Automatically start instead of a on/off button.
